# delim

## Overview
Delim is a sleek and user-friendly application designed to help users keep track of what’s in their kitchen and when it’s set to expire.

The app addresses a common problem: not knowing what’s in your cupboards or fridge, leading to accidental food waste as items pass their expiration dates. By providing users with a simple, customizable database to manage their kitchen inventory, Delim empowers users to take control of their food storage, minimize waste, and save money.

With Delim, users can easily:

* Add items to their inventory with custom details like quantity and expiration dates.
* view, edit, or delete items to keep their inventory up to date.
* get insights on what needs to be used soon, ensuring that nothing goes to waste.

## UX Design Process
### User Stories
I based my design around some core User Stories, the goal was to provide immediate access to the core functionality of the application in a smooth and user firnedly manner, while being aesthetically pleasing and unitrusive.

### Wireframes:
While my end project deviated considerably from my initial wireframes, I feel the core concepts are present and the scope for future features such as recipe suggestions was accounted for in the original design layout.
